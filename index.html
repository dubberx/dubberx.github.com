  Maybe [lkjNP] is supplied by the YTO-extension for Chrome? check that out, anyway!

undo everywhere! normally it is ok, but often I realise a mistake the
  immediately after some action, so just delay/cache/queue the operation and
  pop-up an unobtrusive Undo-button. Why there is is still no option in Gmail to
  'Enable undo-action for sending email (will cause email to be sent X seconds
  later, i.e. not immediately)' I cannot fathom!

Dell Latitude D430 - ACPI suspend
  works fine, s2ram, s2disk, s2both:
  BUT
   * Suspend on close lid, edit /etc/acpi/actions/lm_lid.sh - add something like grep -q -v open/proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state ; then sudo s2ram
   * low battery: poll acpi(1) in crontab, run s2both when below 4%.
